This is a clone of #debian's dpkg bot, which can easily repeat FAQ links and things like that. By default, a cookies file for smuxi is included. Configuration coming soon! For now, edit the code.

## Commands

 * `tell user command` - messages a user with the command
 * `about thing` - gets the cookie
 * `list-cookies` - lists available cookies
